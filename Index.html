            <p>Data science is the field of study that combines domain
                expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of
                mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights
                from data. Data science practitioners apply machine learning
                algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more

                to produce arifienChelligence (Al) systems to perform tasks
                that ordinarily kequire human intelligence. In turn, these
                systems generate insights which analysts and business
                users can translate into tangible business value.</p>

            <h3>Why Data Science is Important?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="para2">More and more companies are coming to realize
            the importance of data scleade, Al, and machine
            learning. Regardless of industry or size,

            organizations.that wish to remain competitive in the
            age of big data need to efficiently develop and
            implement data science capabilities or risk being
            eft behind.
            <br>
            Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and
            predictions making use of predictive causal analytics,
            prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and
            machine learning.
        <br>
        Predictive causal analytics - If you want a model that can
        predict the possibilities of a particular event in the future, you
        need to apply predictive causal analytics. Say, if you are
        providing money on credit, then the probability of customers</div>

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>Machine learning for making predictions</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="para2">If you have transactional data of a finance company
                and need to build a model to determine the future
                trend, then machine learning algorithms are the best
                bet. This falls under the paradigm of supervised
                
                learning. It is called supervised because you already
                have the data based on which you can train your
                machines, For example, a fraud detection model can
                be trained using a historical record of fraudulent
                purchases.

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>Business Intelligence (BI) vs. Data Science</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="para2">Business Intelligence (BI) basically analyzes the previous data to find
                hindsight and insight to describe business trends. Here BI enables
                
                you to take data from external and internal sources, prepare it, run
                queries on it and create dashboards to answer questions like
                quarterly revenue analysis or business problems. BI can evaluate the
                impact of certain events in the near future.
                
                Data Science is a more forward-looking approach, an exploratory
                way with the focus on analyzing the past or current data and
                predicting the future outcomes with the aim of making informed
                decisions.

                <h3>1.Business Understanding</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para2">Business Understanding plays a key role in success of any
                project. We have all the technology to make our lives easy
                but still with this tremendous change a success of any
                project depends on the quality of questions asked for the
                dataset.
                
                Every domain and business work with a set of rules and
                goals. In order to acquire the correct data, we should be
                able to understand the business. Asking questions about
                dataset will hep in narrowing down to correct data
                acquisition.

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>2.Data Collection</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para2">As it is a well-known fact that there is no Data Science without Data. So,
                data serves important ingredient for making any Data Science project. Now
                the question comes where to get the data from. Data could be from various
                sources which could be - logs from webservers, data from online
                
                repositories, data from databases, social media data, data in excel sheet, so
                in short data can come from any source Everywhere data is there.
                Newspaper, journals, online, websites, everything is made up of data only. If
                right questions have been asked in prior step then this becomes an easy
                step to narrow down to correct data sources.

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>3.Data Preparation</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para2">Data may be or may not be in required format. To perform any analytical step
                on the data it needs to be in certain format. It could also be said that data
                needs to be cleaned before processing any further, Thus, this step is also
                known as Data Cleaning or Data Wrangling
                Data acquired in previous step might not give clear analytical picture or
                
                patterns in the data. So, to understand this data needs to be structured and
                cleaned. Might be data is obtained from different sources but for analysis data
                need to be clubbed together from different sources. This is also referred as
                structuring the data. Apart from this data might have missing values which will
                cause obstruction in analysis and model building.
                
         
            </div>

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>4.Data. Modelling</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para2">This stage seems to be most interesting one to
                almost all of the data scientists Many people call it
                "a stage where magic happens". But remember
                magic can happen only if you have correct props
                
                and technique: In terms of data science "Data" is
                that prop and data preparation is that technique.
                
                So before jumping to this step make sure to spend
                
                sufficient amount of time in prior steps.

            <div class="primary1">
                <h3>5.Interpreting Data</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="para2">This is the last step of any Data Science project and also the most important step.
                Execution of this step should be as good as a layman should be able to
                understand the outcome of the project. The predictive power of the model lies in
                oders
                its ability to generalise.
                Actionable insights from the model shows how Data Science has the power of
                
                doing predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. This give us the power to
                learn how to repeat positive result, or how to prevent the negative result.
                Last but not the least, visualization of findings should be done. It should be in line
                with business questions. It should be meaningful to the organisation and the
                stakeholders. Presentation through visualization should be such that it should
                thissensation in the audience.
